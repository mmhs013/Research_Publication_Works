# Time Series (River Discharge) Forecasting using different types of Neural Networks


This repository is created to share  full analysis which done for a book chapter named **_Artificial Neural Network for Streamflow Forecasting_** of the book **Advances in Streamflow Forecasting â€” from Traditional to Modern Approaches**.

The complete analysis is in [here](https://github.com/mmhs013/forecasting-ann/blob/master/Time%20Series%20Forecasting%20using%20different%20types%20of%20Neural%20Networks.ipynb).

More updates are coming.
