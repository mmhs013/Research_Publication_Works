# Time Series (River Discharge) Forecasting using different types of Neural Networks


This repository is created to share  full analysis which done for a book chapter named [**_Application of Different Artificial Neural Network Models in Streamflow Forecasting_**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-820673-7.00006-8) of the book [**Advances in Streamflow Forecasting â€” from Traditional to Modern Approaches**](https://www.elsevier.com/books/advances-in-streamflow-forecasting/sharma/978-0-12-820673-7).

The complete analysis is in [here](https://github.com/mmhs013/Research_Publication_Works/blob/master/1.%20Streamflow%20Book/Time%20Series%20Forecasting%20using%20different%20types%20of%20Neural%20Networks.ipynb).

More updates are coming.
